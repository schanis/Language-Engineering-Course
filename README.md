Labs in Language Engineering Course

ALIGNER
The Aligner.py file contains a Python program for computing and printing the minimum-cost alignment of two strings or two files.

BIGRAM
The BigramTrainer.py file contains a program for reading a corpus, computing unigram counts and bigram probabilities, and printing the model. The Generator.py file contains a program for generating words from a language model. The BigramTester.py file contains a program for reading a model, reading a test corpus, and computing the entropy of the test corpus given the model (the cross-entropy of the training set and the test set).

HMM and Viterbi
The ViterbiBigramDecoder.py file contains a code for applying the Viterbi algorithm to the text correction problem, making the text more legible.

BINARY LOGISTIC REGRESSION
The BinaryLogisticRegression.py file trains a binary logistic regression model from a training set and uses that model to classify words from a test set as either 'name' or 'not name'.

RANDOM INDEXING
The random_indexing.py script creates distributional word embeddings from the 7 books about Harry Potter. It cleans the raw text, creates word vectors and finds closest words using scikit-learn's implementation of kNN algorithm.
